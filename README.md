### Node Express Handlebars Homework

 The purpose of this assignment was to make web app that connected to a database and stored custom burger entries.  You then have the option to devour the burger via a button, which moves it to the other side of the page.  I added an additional button, that would allow you to move it back to the original side.  The buttons updated a boolean property in the database for a specific burger.  Handlebar templates were used in this site, to populate the elements on the page.
